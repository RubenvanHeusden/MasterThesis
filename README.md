# MasterThesis

This repository contains both the (draft version) of the final thesis, as well as the codebase.


## Codebase

The code base contains the following folders:
  * Data classes
    - Contains the classes that represent datasets, these classes also handle file
      reading tokenization, stopword removal etc.
  * Experiments
    - Contains code for running the experiments, this is split in "single task learning" and "multitask learning"
  * Models
    - Contains models that can be used in the experiments (currently an LSTM and a feedforward neural net are implemented)
  * Visualisations
    - contains code for visualizing sentences using t-sne
