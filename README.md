# MasterThesis
Code for the AI Master Thesis of Ruben van Heusden

The repository contains both the (draft version) of the final thesis, as well as the codebase.

In the codebase, a distinction is made between the part containing the models etc, and the part containing code for visualisation
and manual data annotation.
